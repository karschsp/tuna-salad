tuna-salad
==========

I discovered the beauty of this when I met my wife, or, more accurately, her grandmom, who came over from Italy. This tuna salad is not laden with mayo. It's about as healthy as you can get with protein, fish oil, olive oil and egg!  Protein FTW (said the diabtetic).

**Makes 8 servings**

### Ingredients

* 8 4oz cans of Solid white albacore tuna. You can use chunk white if you like. 
* 8 hard-boiled eggs
